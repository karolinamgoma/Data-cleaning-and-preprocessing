# Data cleaning and preprocessing project - Life expectancy dataset
In this project I am focusing on pre-procesing and cleaning technics which are useful if I decide to explore and analyse the dataset more. It answers common question problems like: how to handle missing value, checking outliers, duplicates, inconsistant formatting, basic summary statistic and more.

Data set comes from Kaggle website :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who. 

It consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables which has or not significat effect on the life expectancy.
